# basic-java-calculator
A very basic Java calculator created using AWT and Regular Expressions.

This is not optimized in the least, but may be helpful for those just starting out with AWT.

Each button has a listener that, when the button is clicked, places the value of that button to the end of the `calculation` string. The calculation string's first and second set of numbers are evaluated along with the first separating operand when the equal button is pressed. The result is thusly displayed in the bottom text field and the `calculation` is reset.
